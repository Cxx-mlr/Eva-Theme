### Description
Eva is a colorful and meticulous code theme meet Visual Studio Code.

There are four styles : Dark, Dark Bold, Light, Light Bold. The Bold styles make keywords and function names thicker.

### Installing
You can install this awesome theme through the [Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/akamud.vscode-theme-onelight)

### Attention
There is a little bug when switching themes in vscode. You can not switch Dark with Dark Bold, or Light with Light Bold directly. Please change the color while changing the bold style.

### Proposition
For a better experience, here is my recommended settings:
```json

```



### Customize
If you would like to change some color personaly, you can add snippet in your "settings.json" file, for example:

```json
"workbench.colorCustomizations":{
  "tab.activeBackground": "#282c34",
  "activityBar.background": "#282c34",
  "editorGroup.background": "#282c34",
  "sideBar.background": "#282c34"
}
```

### Developer
Please note that this theme is still in Beta(β) release. If you find any inconsistency in any language, you can help by reporting issues [here](https://github.com/fisheva/Eva-code-themes). Thanks for your issues !
